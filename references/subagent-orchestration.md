# Subagent orchestration contract

Use this contract when one historical Chinese PDF is split among multiple LLM
agents. It supplements the normal proofreading rules; it does not lower the
requirement to treat the PDF image as the text authority.

喺本 skill，phase 3 之後唔開 subagent 做 visual audit：拼書、修書、定稿同 final audit 由 `finish_book.py` 做，下面講嘅 visual audit、visual closure 同 100% 圖像覆核係用戶或者人手 reviewer 對住 `doubts.md` 做；agent 同 subagent 都唔喺對話入面讀頁圖、唔放大、唔自己裁字（主 `SKILL.md`〈做完之後〉）。

## Two separate kinds of parallelism

- LLM subagents transcribe, proofread, or audit bounded scan ranges. Only the
  main agent may create and coordinate them. A child agent must not create
  another agent.
- Raw OCR runs outside the LLM-agent budget, not as LLM agents. Its draft output
  never becomes text authority. Do not spend LLM-agent slots merely to wrap
  identical OCR processes.
  - PaddleOCR-VL and HunyuanOCR are GPU-bound: exactly one resident worker each,
    one engine at a time. Both are VLMs, but they are invoked as fixed pipelines
    with no model or reasoning setting, so neither is an LLM agent. Extra workers
    only contend for VRAM with the local LLM server.
- On a single GPU, run the OCR pass and the proofreading pass in separate
  phases. A local LLM server sized for a large KV cache can leave too little
  VRAM for the OCR pipeline to load at all.
- Keep concurrently active LLM children at or below
  `min(runtime child slots, 8)`. A smaller runtime limit always wins. Do not
  queue overlapping writers merely to fill the available slots.

## Assignment contract

The main agent owns range partitioning and final assembly. Before a child
starts, give it one complete assignment containing:

1. a unique assignment ID and exactly one role:
   `jyut-ocr-segment-writer` or `jyut-ocr-visual-auditor`;
2. the exact source PDF path, its SHA-256, and the in-scope PDF scan count;
3. an inclusive owned scan range or explicit scan set, plus the adjacent
   boundary-context scans that may be read but not written;
4. an exact mapping from every assigned scan to its individual
   original/full-resolution render, current render SHA-256, temporary page
   marker, and printed-page label when one exists;
5. the writer's single segment output path, or for an auditor, the candidate
   path and sealed candidate SHA-256 to inspect;
6. the selected `basic`, `structured`, or `release` profile; local repo rules;
   notation policy; known corrections; and risk flags such as tables, rotated
   spreads, duplicates, missing pages, faint text, footnotes, running furniture,
   or uncertain boundaries; and
7. the required report fields and any project-local manifests or evidence paths
   the child must read.

Do not start an assignment with a missing field, a source/render hash mismatch,
an output path owned by another writer, or an owned scan that overlaps another
active writer. Report the conflict to the main agent instead.

## Segment writer lifecycle

The writer owns only its assigned segment and scan range.

1. Verify the source and render hashes before reading OCR drafts or changing
   text. Treat PaddleOCR-VL, HunyuanOCR, GJ.cool, Gemini, and other OCR as
   hints only.
2. Read boundary-context scans for joins, headings, lists, tables, and footnotes,
   but do not transcribe them into a second segment or modify their owner's
   files.
3. Write only the assigned segment output. Never edit the final assembled
   Markdown, another segment, a page/render manifest, or release evidence owned
   by the main agent.
4. Check every owned scan against its individual original/full-resolution
   render. Preserve temporary page markers and report any unresolved character,
   missing/duplicate scan, or boundary decision.
5. Finish the segment, compute SHA-256 from its exact bytes, and return a
   candidate seal containing assignment ID, path, SHA-256, owned scan set,
   marker coverage, unresolved findings, and boundary notes.
6. Enter **STOP-WRITE** immediately after returning the seal. Do not make even a
   small cleanup edit, respond to a review finding with a patch, or refresh the
   hash unless the main agent explicitly opens a new amendment assignment.

Any byte change after sealing invalidates that candidate and every audit based
on it. The main agent must designate one writer, produce a new SHA-256 seal, and
send the affected scans and boundary context to a different auditor again.

## Independent visual auditor lifecycle

The auditor must be a different agent from the writer and is read-only. It must
not patch the candidate, use shell redirection to change it, or generate a
replacement segment.

Before spawning it, the main agent must confirm that the platform's effective
permission/sandbox mode is still read-only. A live parent `yolo`, bypass, or
other broader runtime override can supersede an adapter default; an agent
started under such an override does not qualify as the read-only auditor in
this contract. Start the audit in an effective read-only/plan turn instead.

1. Recompute the candidate SHA-256 and reject drift from the writer's seal.
2. Verify the source and render hashes, then inspect 100% of the assigned scans
   using the individual original/full-resolution renders. Contact sheets,
   thumbnails, and OCR output are navigation aids only.
3. Inspect the supplied boundary-context scans as context, without claiming
   ownership or duplicating their coverage.
4. Check faithful text, original glyphs and punctuation, page furniture,
   marker coverage and order, cross-page joins, headings, lists, tables,
   footnotes, and every assignment-specific risk flag.
5. Return the sealed SHA-256, exact checked scan set, exact context scan set,
   per-scan evidence disposition, boundary conclusions, and an explicit list of
   open findings. An audit passes only with 100% assigned-scan coverage and zero
   open findings.

If the candidate needs a patch, report the finding and stop. A read-only audit
never converts itself into a writer assignment.

## Main-agent closure

Before assembly, the main agent must verify that:

- writer-owned scan sets are mutually exclusive and together cover the intended
  scope;
- every current segment byte-matches its writer seal;
- every segment has a passing audit from a different agent, with 100% owned
  scans plus the required boundary context accounted for;
- no writer remains active or may still modify a sealed segment; and
- cross-segment boundaries, marker order, structure, and unresolved findings
  are reconciled.

最終 Markdown 由 `finish_book.py` 拼（佢係唯一 assembly owner），拼書之後嘅 deterministic 檢查都係佢做；visual closure 係用戶或者人手 reviewer 嘅（見上面）。A late patch invalidates the
affected seal and audit and returns that range to the amendment lifecycle; it
must not be applied silently to an already accepted candidate.
