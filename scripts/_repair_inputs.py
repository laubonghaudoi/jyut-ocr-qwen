"""The book repair tool's inputs (scripts/repair_book.py): where they are,
what they must hold before anything is repaired, and their hashes.

Everything here reads; nothing writes.  The inputs are the sealed pages
(proofread/page-NNNN.{md,json}), the annotated assembly and its page list,
both engine drafts, the renders, the book profile and the page manifest.  The
tool refuses (InputError, exit 2) when:

- a sealed page's Markdown or JSON does not match its own seal (the hashes
  phase 3 writes in `provenance`), or the page list's recorded hashes;
- the assembled page text is not the sealed page text (both `strip()`ped),
  or the assembly's page markers are not the marker pages;
- a render's hash is not the page manifest's.

and it refuses an output folder (OutputError) that is, or lies inside, an
input folder, or that already exists without --resume (or, with it, that
this tool did not write, or that holds a link where the tool writes).
hash_inputs() hashes
every file read, before the run and again after it, so a run that changed
an input is reported, whoever changed it.
