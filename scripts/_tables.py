"""Tables in a finished page: Markdown pipe tables and HTML tables.

A Markdown table cannot say that one cell spans several rows or columns, and
printed tables do that - a notes column shared by three rows of a textbook
list, a year heading over three month columns.  So a finished page may carry
an HTML <table> where cells are merged, and a Markdown table everywhere else.
Both are read here into one grid model, so a checker, the auditor and the
regression suite agree on what a table is.  Both are also written here, so the
pipeline emits one markup for each kind.

Standard library only: the regression runner and the auditor import this.

    record per row or a column per row - and, where the grid has a title row
    across its top or a note row across its foot (band_rows), the grid below
    the title and/or above the note transposed, the bands kept where they
    are across the transposed grid's width.  A price table written with a
    column per row, its title row and its note row across the top and the
    foot, is the same table as its golden written a record per row, the note
    a column beside the records: the grid under the title transposed.

    Nothing else.  Records in reverse order, each record's fields reversed,
    a grid upside down or turned a quarter are not in the ruling: a scorer
    that took them for the golden would pass a table the pipeline turned the
    wrong way, the fault the orientation and reading-direction steps are
    scored for.  They wait for the user's ruling.

    In order: as written, then the transposes that keep the most title and
    note rows where they are, the whole grid transposed last - a title stays
    a title, so where two score alike the scorer reads the table with its
