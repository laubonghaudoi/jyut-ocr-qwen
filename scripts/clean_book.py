"""Clean a finished book's working files: the pictures the pipeline cuts
again from the renders, the stale assemblies, its temporary files and the
draft.  The text state stays; the renders go unless --keep-renders.

    python3 scripts/clean_book.py BOOK [--dry-run] [--keep-renders] [--all]

BOOK is finish_book.py's book folder.  finish_book.py runs this cleanup
itself as its fifth step, with the renders kept, once both copies are
beside the PDF (--keep-work: not at all; --clean-renders: the renders too);
this command is for a book finished before that step existed, for the
renders once the person wants them gone, for --dry-run, and for --all.

Why.  Measured by du on two finished books (2026-10-02): the pictures are
about nine tenths of what the pipeline writes.  A 609-page book's folder
held 635 MB - renders/ 132 MB, phase 3's adjudication and stitch crops
under proofread/ 189 MB, repaired/crops/ 119 MB, book-profile-crops/ 13
MB, a stale assembly 4 MB, and a backup folder the person's session made
132 MB - against some 45 MB of text state (that book was measured, not
cleaned); of a 396-page book's 411 MB (136 MB of it the same kind of
backup) this command freed 250 MB on a scratch copy, renders included.
The text state is what a later repair in place reads (the user's rule:
repair the output in place, no full re-run): the sealed pages, both
engines' drafts, repaired/ without its crops, assembled/, the profile, the
page manifest, finish/, final.md and doubts.md.  The crops are cut from
the renders as needed.  The renders come back from the PDF -
`survey_pdf.py PDF MANIFEST_DIR --renders-only` renders the pages missing
from renders/ and verifies each against the page manifest's
render_sha256, rewriting nothing else - but as the same bytes only while
pdftoppm renders them the same: the repair in place verifies every render
against the manifest, so with another poppler the book could not be
repaired in place at all (3 pages of the 396-page book rendered the same
under poppler 26.01 after the OS upgrade of 2026-10-02; today's
measurement, not a guarantee).  That is why finish_book.py keeps them, and
why cleaned.json records the pdftoppm installed when they went.

What goes, by default - each item printed with its bytes:
- the renders folder the page manifest names (--keep-renders keeps it);
- phase 3's crops directly in the sealed pages' folder, by their names
  (page-NNNN-adjudication-NN.png, -chart-NN.png, -table-unread-NN.png,
  -stitch-NN.png); any other picture there is the person's and stays;
- repaired/crops/ (the repair's question crops) and book-profile-crops/;
- assembled.stale-*/, .assembled.partial/, and the temporary files the
  pipeline writes beside its outputs (left only by a crash): only the
  shapes it writes, for the outputs it writes in that folder;
- BOOK/draft.md, and X-draft.md beside the PDF when it hashes to a version
  the pipeline wrote there (one the person edited stays).
The sealed pages' folder, the profile and the page manifest are the ones
finish_book.py's report (or finish_book.py itself, in its fifth step)
names, when they lie in BOOK; one outside BOOK contributes nothing, and no
folder of the same name in BOOK stands in for it.  Everything else stays
and is listed as left alone: the text state, the logs, finish/, backup-*/
or anything the pipeline did not write, and beside the PDF the PDF itself,
X.md, X-doubts.md and the *.edited-*.md copies.

Before anything is removed, every one of these must hold, else exit 3
with one line saying which, and nothing is removed:
- finish/finish-report.json says the last finish_book.py ended with exit 0
  (or stopped at its inputs for want of the renders this command removed:
  its line names cleaned.json and --renders-only);
- the page manifest names a PDF that exists and hashes to the recorded
  SHA-256;
- no finish_book.py runs on the book (finish/.lock) and no delivery is
  being written (.delivered.lock); both locks are held while cleaning;
- no other process still works on the book: one of the pipeline's commands
  that names BOOK, works in it or has a file of one of its folders open
  (phase 3 and repair_book.py hold no lock a cleanup could check), or any
  process that names BOOK and works in it or has such a file open;
  wait_for_run.py, which only reads along, and a `tail -f` on a log at the
  book's root or in finish/ do not count;
- delivered.json records X.md and X-doubts.md beside the PDF, both are
  there, and BOOK/final.md is the version last copied there.  A copy there
  that hashes to none of its recorded versions is the person's now: the
  default cleanup still runs; --all is refused and says why.

--all removes the whole book folder (with everything in it) and the
unedited X-draft.md, nothing else: for when the person wants the space
back entirely, with X.md and X-doubts.md beside the PDF as the book.  It
is refused, nothing removed, when X.md or X-doubts.md beside the PDF was
edited (the folder is then the only copy of the pipeline's text); when the
PDF, X.md or X-doubts.md lies inside BOOK (they would go with it); when
BOOK holds *.edited-*.md, backup-*/ or .git (the person's, not to be made
again: they move them out first); or when a sealed page in BOOK is not the
one final.md was built from (assembled/page-sources.json's hashes: the
text state moved on since the delivery - finish_book.py first).
--dry-run prints the same list and removes nothing.  Running it twice is
harmless: the second run finds nothing to remove (exit 0).

Every deletion goes through remove(), which refuses a path not under BOOK
(the draft copy beside the PDF apart) and unlinks a symlink instead of
following it (the offline checks' books link renders/ and the drafts to
shared folders).  After a default cleanup BOOK/cleaned.json records what
went, what stayed, the bytes freed, the inputs, how to resume and - when
the renders went - the pdftoppm installed; a cleanup stopped part way
writes it too, with `stopped`.  stdout ends with
`[clean] RESULT exit=N DONE|STOPPED|REFUSED clean_book.py: ...`.

Exit codes:
    0  done - also a dry run, and a run that finds nothing left to remove
    1  stopped part way: a removal failed (the line says which; what was
       removed before it is listed, and cleaned.json records it with
       `stopped`) - run the same command again
    2  wrong arguments, or BOOK is not a folder
    3  refused: a condition above does not hold; nothing was removed
