"""The second of three deliveries: the book while phase 3 proofreads it.

proofreading.md holds every page of the book in scan order (the page
manifest's pages, as scripts/build_draft.py lists them):

- a page whose seal is complete and intact - page-NNNN.json and
  page-NNNN.md in the proofread folder, the JSON canonical, of this schema,
  status complete, the Markdown's hash and the payload's hash what the seal
  says (stitch_tables.sealed_page, the part of proofread_pages.py's resume
  check that does not depend on the run's arguments) - as proofread;
- every other page as the draft writes it (engine B's text, running heads and
  folios taken off): a page not reached yet, a page being sealed while this
  runs (its Markdown written, its seal not yet, or half of either), a page
  whose seal was edited;
- no page markers (a proofread page carrying one loses it); a page break is a
  paragraph break - joining a sentence across pages is the repair step's work,
  for the final delivery;
- a header line: pages proofread out of how many, and when it was built.

A proofread page whose text is empty stays empty: the table stitch moved its
text to the page where the table starts (its seal's tableStitch).

Cheap enough to rebuild every few minutes (a 488-page book: about a second),
and written through a temporary file and a rename, so a reader never sees half
of it.  scripts/wait_for_run.py --progress BOOK rebuilds it while it waits
on phase 3.  Nothing in the proofread folder is written.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/build_progress.py BOOK [--output-dir proofread] [--ocr-dir ocr-hunyuan]
        [--manifest page-manifest.json] [--output proofreading.md]

Relative paths are taken inside BOOK.  One line is printed; exit 0 when
the file is written, 1 when it could not be.
