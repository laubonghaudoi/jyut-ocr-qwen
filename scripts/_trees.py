"""A printed chart - a brace tree, a classification or organisation chart -
read from text in any form a person or a model may draw it: a nested list, an
indented or box-drawn tree (a file tree), a sideways brace drawing, a Mermaid
graph.

One parser for both sides: the regression suite scores an output's chart
against a golden with it (golden_tree), and the pipeline accepts a model's
reading of a chart with it (proofread_pages.py), so any form the scorer can
read is a form the pipeline accepts.

Standard library only: the regression runner imports this.
