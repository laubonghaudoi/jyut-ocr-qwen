"""The book model of the book repair tool (scripts/repair_book.py): what the
repair rules need to know about one book, learned from its own drafts and
renders, with no model call - written to book-model.json.

Each entry is measured here and carries a gate: whether the book shows it
clearly enough for a rule to act on it, with the numbers.  A rule whose gate
failed stays silent on that book and its sites become questions or doubts
(`gate-failed`); nothing here is a constant of one book.

- M-1 head band, per page parity: the folio blocks (engine A's `number`
  blocks) give the band's place; the band holds the folio, the blocks phase
  3's furniture_band takes (switch C4's test), and the short thin blocks in
  the band's column (or the folio's row) at the page's outer edge - the
  column the page's own band blocks mark, the parity's folio strip only on
  a page with none, and no other block beyond it.  Of furniture_band's
  picks, a folio must lie at the parity's folio place and a block taken by
  its text where the parity's running heads run (unplaced_heads); a stem
  set in display type is the page's own text (drop_display_heads).
- M-2 stems: the profile's running heads, or the most shared core of the
  band's text; M-2b the characters the engines read at a stem's places.
- M-3 run suffixes: what the band prints beside the stem, the same on three
  or more consecutive pages (a volume label, the contents word).
- M-4 folio sequence: per run, the offset scan - folio that most readings
  agree on, and the jumps where leaves are missing.
- M-5 dividers: the page that opens a run and prints its suffix in display
  type.
- M-6 contents pages: a run of list-like pages whose lines map, in order,
  onto the book's other lines.
- M-7 engine B's stand-ins: its mark aliases (phase 3's mark_evidence /
  mark_aliases), and the glyphs it writes where engine A printed figures
  (not CJK numerals: those read the figure in the other script), dashes and
  dots.
- M-8 geometry: pitch, cells per column, text frame and column tops per page
  (_repair_geometry.py); M-8b the paragraph-indent clusters, and whether
  the print opens its paragraphs at the indent (the column after one that
  ends short).
- M-9 body glyph size; M-10 sentence-final marks and the date shape.
