"""Offline checks of a punctuation pass whose answers are both refused.

No model, no GPU, no corpus.  The shape is the one measured on a magazine page:
engine B wrote printed commas as a look-alike character (丶) that the merge kept,
the punctuator read it as the comma it is and dropped it, and both its answers
were refused for changing the characters - while engine A had printed the comma
at that place.  The stretch now keeps the marks the refused answer and engine A
agree on, and is reported partial, instead of being left bare.

Usage:
