"""Offline checks of switch --loop-detector (on by default since the round-4
benchmark, the user's decision of 2026-09-30; --no-loop-detector turns it
off).

No model, no GPU, no corpus.  The text is made up.  With the switch the
client streams every request and watches the reasoning as it comes
(Client._read_stream, scripts/_loop_watch.py); when the reasoning ends in one
passage written three times back to back, word for word, it gives the request
up and the effort ladder treats it exactly as a cut at max_tokens.  Checked:

- the rule (loop_at): three back-to-back copies of a passage are a loop, two
  and a bit are not, nor a passage written three times with other reasoning
  between, nor one longer than period_max; a short passage needs at least
  `repeated` characters of repetition; repeated_run against brute force;
  LoopWatch looks every `step` characters, whatever the pieces it is fed;
- the stream reader: a finished stream is read as the payload the endpoint
  answers unstreamed (answer, reasoning, finish reason, usage, timings); a
  looping one is closed where the loop is found, the lines after it unread,
  and read as a cut at max_tokens with the server's token count (or one per
  delta without it); the answer is never watched; an error event is a
  ProofreadError, a stream that ends before the model finished a dropped
  connection (retried);
- faults in a stream: comments (keep-alive), an event with no data, CRLF
  line ends are passed over; an event that cannot be read (not JSON, not
  UTF-8, not an object) is a dropped connection, the request asked again
  (over HTTP too, chunked as ninfer's library streams); a stream that ends
  after the finish but before its usage keeps its answer, with the server's
  live count for its tokens;
- the request: off, the body as before, unstreamed; on, streamed, and what
  request_body gives is what is sent (the pair-class store's key), keyed
  apart from the answers without the switch;
- the ladder (a stand-in transport that streams, over the runner's own
  Client.ask, ask_answering and _read_stream): a loop cut goes on to the next
  rung with the full max_tokens, as a cut at max_tokens does without the
  switch, and the same answer comes back for fewer tokens; never the same
  rung again for a CALL_BUDGETS budget; a loop cut on a rung R2-C capped is
  no early cut; the bookkeeping (rungsAsked, rungsCutOff, degraded, loopCuts,
  no_answer's reason) and the ledger (loopWatched, loopCut,
  loopCutTokensSaved); a loop that would have ended in an empty reply is
  answered a rung lower;
- a whole page (proofread_pages.main with the stand-in): the page's text as
  without the switch, one decisionChanges entry at the spot, the calls,
  provenance, the run report and pages[]; off, none of their keys; a page
  sealed with the switch is not current without it, nor the other way round;
  the default is the switch on, as with --loop-detector, which is still
  accepted;
- over HTTP (a stand-in server in this process on a free port): the client
  closes the connection where the loop is found, while the server still has
  lines to send, and the next rung answers.
