"""Checks for the mark rule (decision D1): a character one engine has in excess where
the other engine printed a mark is that mark misread, for the glyphs this book's
drafts show the engine writing for marks.

No model, no GPU, no corpus.  The shapes are the ones measured on a magazine page:
engine B wrote full-cell commas as 丶, a colon and an opening quote as 号一, a
printed ▲ as 厶, and the merge kept them as characters while engine A had printed
every mark.
