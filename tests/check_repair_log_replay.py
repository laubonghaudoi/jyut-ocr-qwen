"""Offline check of the book repair tool's offset edits, repair log, doubts
and log replay (scripts/_repair_edits.py, scripts/repair_book.py).

No model, no GPU, no corpus: made-up page texts and a made-up book
(tests/repair_fixture.py), with made-up stages put in the tool's stage list.

- Edits of one stage apply against the text the stage saw: each record's
  offset is into the page as it stands just before that record, so replaying
  the log on the sealed pages gives the repaired pages; an insertion at a
  span's edge goes before it; an edit that changes nothing is not logged.
- Two edits over the same text: the first proposed is applied, the other is
  a `conflict` doubt naming both; two insertions at one place conflict; an
  insertion strictly inside another span conflicts; touching spans do not.
- An edit names its rule or its question; a question's edit carries its
  answer, crop and crop hash (ValueError otherwise), and record_problems()
  names a record that lacks any of them.
- A replay whose record does not hold at its offset raises ReplayError.
- Through repair_book.py: a made-up furniture stage's edits reach
  pages/*.md and combined-repaired.md, the log replays to them byte for
  byte, and the report counts the rule; --resume removes an earlier run's
  pages, log and repaired book first, so a resumed subset or plan never
  sits beside them; --no-furniture turns the stage off;
  a log written wrong (a shifted offset) fails the run with exit 5; a
  question the stage plans becomes a `look-not-asked` doubt under
  --no-model, and a planned question with no doubt under --plan-only,
  which writes repair-plan.jsonl and no repaired text; --verify-sample 1
  plans a print question for every mechanical edit; a failed gate of the
  book model is a `gate-failed` doubt and a folio jump a `leaves-missing`
  one.
