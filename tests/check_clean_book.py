"""Offline check of scripts/clean_book.py, finish_book.py's fifth step and
survey_pdf.py --renders-only.

No GPU, no corpus, no model server: tests/check_finish_book.py's made-up
book (tests/repair_fixture.py's, as phase 3 leaves it), finished with
--no-model and delivered beside a made-up PDF in a temporary folder, then
dressed with the pictures the real pipeline leaves - phase 3's crops beside
the sealed pages, the repair's crops, the profile's crops, a stale
assembly, a partial one, temporary files - and with what is not the
pipeline's: a backup folder, a log, a copy moved aside beside the PDF, the
person's own pictures and .tmp files among the pipeline's.

- Refused, nothing removed (exit 3, the line says which): no finish yet,
  X.md gone from beside the PDF, final.md edited after the delivery, a
  finish that did not end with exit 0 - an exit-2 one too unless its line
  names cleaned.json and --renders-only -, the manifest the finish used
  gone, the PDF gone, a finish_book.py holding its lock, a delivery holding
  its lock, a process still working on the book (one that names the folder
  and has a render open or works in it; a pipeline command given the folder
  on its command line) - and not a wait_for_run.py reading along, nor a
  process merely in the folder, nor one tailing a log.
- --dry-run: exit 0, the right items with their bytes, nothing removed, no
  cleaned.json.
- The default: exactly the regenerable set goes (renders/, phase 3's crops
  by name, repaired/crops/, book-profile-crops/, the stale and partial
  assemblies, the pipeline's temporary files, draft.md, the unedited
  X-draft.md); the text state, backup-*/, the log, finish/, the person's
  Cover.PNG and .tmp files, and beside the PDF the PDF, X.md, X-doubts.md
  and the *.edited-*.md copy stay; cleaned.json records it with the bytes
  freed, the inputs, the pdftoppm and how to resume; the RESULT line says
  what was freed.
- A second run removes nothing (exit 0).
- The removal set is the finish's inputs: sealed pages read elsewhere leave
  BOOK/proofread/ alone; of two manifests the finish's one is planned from.
- X-draft.md beside the PDF goes only when it is a version the pipeline
  wrote; an edited X.md there lets the default cleanup run and refuses
  --all, which says why; --all removes the book folder and never the PDF,
  X.md or X-doubts.md.
- --all refused, nothing removed: the PDF (and so X.md) inside the book
  folder, in three layouts; *.edited-*.md, backup-*/ or .git in it; a page
  sealed again after the delivery.  The default cleanup still runs then.
- A renders/ that is a symlink is unlinked, not followed; remove() refuses
  a path outside the book folder.
- Stopped part way (a folder that cannot be written in): exit 1 naming
  what went, cleaned.json with `stopped`, finish_book.py's hint, and the
  same command again finishes the job; a Refused inside the removal is a
  stop too, never "nothing removed".
- finish_book.py --no-model on a delivered book: its fifth step cleans with
  the renders kept, the report, the log and the RESULT line say so, and a
  later finish needs no re-render; --clean-renders removes them and the
  next finish's exit-2 line holds the whole resume command; a stop part
  way is `cleanup stopped`; --keep-work keeps the pictures and says so; so
  does --no-deliver.
- survey_pdf.py --renders-only on a made-up three-page PDF (pdftoppm, no
  GPU): the missing render comes back, every render hashes to the
  manifest's, the manifest and the report keep their bytes; a render that
  differs is exit 2 naming both pdftoppm versions, --overwrite renders it
  again; another PDF is exit 2.
- The skill's text names the tool, its switches, the fifth step, what it
  keeps and why, the refusals and the resume command.
