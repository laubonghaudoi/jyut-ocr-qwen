"""Offline check that the book repair tool (scripts/repair_book.py) reads its
inputs and writes only its output folder, and refuses what it must refuse.

No model, no GPU, no corpus: a made-up book (tests/repair_fixture.py).

- A run on the book writes only --output: every file under the book folder
  keeps its bytes, and the report's input hashes equal the files'.  On a
  book with nothing to repair, the repaired annotated book is the assembly
  byte for byte; the report says which stages ran, which are off and which
  are not built.
- An existing output is refused (exit 3), and so is --resume on a folder the
  tool did not write, or one whose pages/ is a link (into the sealed pages:
  the resumed run would remove and write them); --resume on its own output
  runs.
- An output that is the book folder, or inside proofread/, assembled/,
  renders/ or an ocr-* folder, is refused (exit 2) and nothing is written
  there - also inside assembled/ before the assembly exists (the page list
  and manifest are there), and inside an ocr-* folder the run does not
  read.
- An assembled page that differs from its sealed page, a sealed page whose
  Markdown no longer matches its seal, a sealed JSON edited after sealing, a
  page list whose recorded hash differs, and a render that is not the page
  manifest's are each refused (exit 2) before anything is written.
- --pages without --assembled builds the annotated text from the chosen
  sealed pages; the report says so; the book model is still the whole
  book's.
- An input that changes while the tool runs fails the run (exit 2) and the
  report names it.
