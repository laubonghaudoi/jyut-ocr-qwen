"""Offline checks of the doubts that keep a page from being sealed clean.

No model, no GPU, no corpus: synthetic readings and a fake client only, so the
checks run anywhere the scripts do.  Each case is a shape measured on real
sealed pages (see the docstrings of punctuation_doubts and extra_copies); the
