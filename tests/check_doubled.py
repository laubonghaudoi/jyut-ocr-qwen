"""Checks for doubled circles 。。 in the punctuation step: the census reports the places
a mark is printed and, apart, how many are doubled circles; the prompts and the gates
use both; the notation probe reads a doubled-circle-only answer; the whole-page
formatter is told the rule and its first refused answer's reason is sealed.

No model, no GPU, no corpus.  The shapes are the ones measured on two books printing
doubled circles: a census that counted each pair once held answers to half their
marks and refused the right ones; a block of doubled circles alone was read as
unpunctuated by the probe.

Usage: python3 tests/check_doubled.py   (exits non-zero on the first failure)
