"""Offline checks of switch --learned-heads (on by default since the round-4
benchmark, the user's decision of 2026-09-30; --no-learned-heads turns it
off, in proofread_pages.py and in book_profile.py).

No model, no GPU, no corpus.  The profile measures a running head by verbatim
recurrence, so it learns the title a head column prints on every page, and
not what is printed beside it - a volume label that changes every few pages,
the folio that changes every page.  With the switch the running head is
learned by where it is printed (learn_heads): the blocks holding the title at
its type size (anchors), what stands in their column (a label beside the
title on several pages, and the family of labels that differ in a numeral;
the folio sequence), and where the anchors stand on odd and on even pages.

A made-up book of fourteen vertical pages, its head column in the outer margin
(right on odd pages, left on even ones): the title, a volume label and the
folio, read by the layout as one block or several.  Engine B reads the head
column in its stream.  The shapes:

- the title and label in one block, and the label in a block of its own
  beside the title, and the folio: left out with the switch, kept without
  (a paragraph, a line);
- a label the book never printed beside the title but of the learned family
  (a later volume): left out;
- a volume divider printing the label as a large title in the body, beside
  the running head: the title kept, whatever the switch;
- a page whose anchor engine A did not read: a label block in the learned
  region at the head's size left out; a numeral block there kept (the body
  prints numbers too), and a short body line there kept;
- a label not learned (another word in the head column): kept;
- the title read wrongly twice over (not the stem): kept, the label beside
  it (in the learned region) left out;
- a folio of one numeral the body holds too: a stretch of the body with it
  that the structure pass drops is still refused by the deletion guard;
- engine B's reading of the head column (title, label, folio) in the middle
  of the body, engine A reading none: left out before 裁決 with the switch;
- engine B's label alone between the head and the folio: asked of 裁決 with
  the switch alone; with --folio-furniture as well, the band's;
- the body naming the book (the title, or the title one character short) in
  a sentence whose words only one engine read, inside a block of engine A's:
  kept and asked of 裁決, with the switch as without; engine A's second
  reading of the head inside a body block, only the folio between it and the
  block's end: left out;
- the head drifting over the book, so its learned region takes in the column
  beside it: on a page whose anchor is read, a column there reading a
  volume's name alone is kept.

And: the structure pass refused and its fallback, which keeps no head block
the switch left out; the profile's learnedHeads (book_profile.py
--learned-heads), inert without the switch, and learning from the drafts the
same way when the profile has none; the record (decisionChanges, provenance,
the run report); resume; the default, the switch on in both scripts, as with
--learned-heads, which is still accepted.
