"""Offline checks of --keep-arabic-numerals (on by default since the round-4
benchmark, the user's decision of 2026-09-30; --no-keep-arabic-numerals
turns it off).

No model, no GPU, no corpus.  The merge keeps characters only (CJK), so an
Arabic figure engine A read - a list item's (1), a contents entry's 12, a
heading's 5. - stands in the page only where the punctuator or the structure
pass writes it, and engine B's reading of the figure (a glyph such as 丄 or 工
for 1, 八…一 for its brackets) could stand instead.  With the switch the merge
writes engine A's figure where it is the only reading of its print, and only
a figure that continues a numbering.  The pages are made up, in the shapes
measured on the sealed pages of a book printing Arabic item, contents and
heading numbers:

- a list whose figures engine B read as glyphs it writes for figures and
  marks on this book (stand-ins), and the same list with the switch off;
- contents lines where engine B read no figure at all;
- a figure engine A misread, which breaks the numbering on both sides;
- a folio in a number block (furniture), never a list's number;
- a figure engine B read as a numeral, which 裁決 is asked about as without
  the switch: its answer that the figure is printed writes it, an answer
  that reads the numeral keeps engine B's reading;
- a character only engine B read at a figure's place that is no stand-in,
  and a figure beside a replacement of unequal readings: neither is written,
  and no character both engines read is replaced;
- a structure pass that leaves the figures out: they are written back;
- a punctuator that already wrote a figure, at its place or after the entry;
- the page's budget of questions (--max-adjudications) as with it off;
- resume: a page sealed with it is not current for a run without it;
- the default: the switch on, as with --keep-arabic-numerals, which is still
  accepted.
