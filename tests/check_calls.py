"""Offline checks of how phase 3 makes its model calls.

No model, no GPU, no corpus: a local stub server that answers like ninfer
(usage plus llama.cpp-style `timings`), and made-up disagreements.  Covers the
per-page call ledger, the global in-flight cap (and the book profile's), per-kind
budgets that escalate at the same effort, the images as sent (pixel budget,
aspect ratio) and the lone-circle rule.

Usage:
