"""Offline check of engine B's second look (scripts/run_hunyuanocr_second_look.py).

No GPU, no model: a made-up book of four pages, engine A's blocks with boxes,
engine B's sealed page pairs written by the runner's own functions, and a
stand-in for the OCR server that answers by the crop it is sent.

- A block engine B's page text lacks is read from its crop and put into the
  page after the line of the block before it; two unread blocks that follow one
  another are one crop; the page's TXT, JSON lines, seal and `secondLook`
  record agree, and the runner still takes the page for current.
- Left alone: a block engine B read (in other forms: a variant character); a
  furniture block; a block whose text stands on three pages (a running head);
  a reading that is not the blocks' (it is recorded, not written); a line of a
  reading that the page already holds.
- A second call does nothing; a changed engine A draft makes the page be done
  again from engine B's own lines; the report counts; exit codes.
- SKILL.md and references/long-book-workflow.md order the step after engine A
  and build the draft again.
