"""Offline check that the skill's own text stays generic: SKILL.md, references/
and the bundled scripts name no test case and quote no golden.

The skill runs on books it has never seen; the calibration books are examples,
and their facts live in tests/cases/ and tests/golden/ only (SKILL.md, "經驗泛化同
技能更新門檻").  A comment that cites a measurement describes the failure's shape,
not the page's text.  Two things are checked, both mechanical:

- no case id of tests/cases/ (the file names and their bookId) appears;
- no run of QUOTE_LENGTH or more CJK characters of a golden (its CJK read in
  order, cells and lines run together, so a figure glued across two cells
  counts too) appears in a line of the text.

Book titles and page numbers written in prose are not checked: older comments
still carry some, and the check names only what it can find without a list.

Usage:
    python3 tests/check_generic_text.py
