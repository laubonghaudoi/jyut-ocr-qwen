"""Checks for the text-loss fixes the user approved on 2026-09-27.

- The drafts are aligned on variant-folded text (align_drafts).
- A lopsided replacement is split into its like-for-like part and text only one
  engine read (split_lopsided); the surplus goes the way an insertion goes, and the
  book's furniture in it is left out.
- A reading of more than ANSWER_DELETION_LIMIT characters the merge drops is a
  doubt (readings_dropped).
- 裁決's 無 on a crop cut where the spot was estimated to be deletes only once a
  blind reading of the crop shows the spot empty (crop_shows_spot, confirm_nothing).
- D16 lets 裁決's answer go where what it leaves out already stands nearby
  (reading_nearby).

No model, no GPU, no corpus.  The shapes are the round-2 losses: a line engine A
skipped fused with a variant form of the next heading's character, with engine A's
bullet read as 〇, and with engine A's folio; two crops that did not show the spot.

Usage: python3 tests/check_text_loss.py   (exits non-zero when a check fails)
