"""Offline checks of --neighbour-guard (on by default since the round-4
benchmark, the user's decision of 2026-09-30; --no-neighbour-guard turns it
off).

No model, no GPU, no corpus.  裁決 sometimes answers a disagreement with the
text right beside the spot, which neither engine read there: a crop that
does not show the spot (it begins at the next character, or ends at the one
before), or shows a bracketed numeral, a folio or a mark next to a spot
where one engine read a bracket or a rule as a character.  Written, the page
has that text twice.  With the switch, such an answer is not written: the
reading of the engine the page falls back on stands, as it read it (on a D3
question, the reading of the engine that read the text), with a doubt.  The
pages are made up, in the shapes measured on the sealed runs:

- the answer is a numeral two places after the spot, where one engine read a
  bracket as a numeral and the other nothing (a numeral question);
- a substitution answered with the character two places after the spot, on
  a book whose fallback engine is A and on one whose fallback engine is B;
- a D3 question (one engine read a short run the other did not) answered
  with the next character: the run the engine read stands;
- what is not a copy: an engine read the answer at the spot too (a doubled
  character one engine read twice), the text three places away, an answer
  that is an engine's reading in another form (a variant pair), a character
  beside the spot that another question's answer wrote (the context 裁決 was
  shown does not have it there);
- the switch off: the answer written, as before, and nothing sealed;
- resume: a page sealed with it is not current for a run without it;
- the default: the switch on, as with --neighbour-guard, which is still
  accepted.
